Personal project that I develop in order to test my skills and knowledge in Lists(arrays), useContext, useCallback, memo and useMemo do
To react.

All data sent and received were treated through global opinions created within my context. This made it much easier to deal with comparisons and relationships between the main user, who will be the logged-in user, and the secondary users, who will be your logged-in contacts on the other side of the screen and also the chats.

It's also worth mentioning the fact that Typescript is very useful in projects like this. In addition to the security that we have from non-original non-typing and that helps our construction, we still have the intellisense of VSCode to give us completing the typed objects.
It's surreal and saves a lot of time and headaches. 😂
Have you ever thought about stopping to remember the name of each field that is inside the mapped object.

Finally, I used Firebase on the backend, but I have to confess that it wasn't a simple experience, let alone an easy one.😂
But it is an extraordinary tool and I am sure I will continue to study it and use it in new projects, both personal and professional.
